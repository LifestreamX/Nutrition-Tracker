## About The App

[nutritiontracker] is a nutrition tracker app for the user and their nutrition information. The user can set macronutrient goals and keep track of them with charts on the user dashboard. The user can use a nutrition API to search for specific foods that they can view with the option of charts to display the data and add the food item to their dashboard to compare to their goals they have set. The user can submit the log for that day to their food logs which they have access to in their food log page to keep track of every food item for that day sorted by date with pagination as the logs grow in size. The site has form validation for account creation along with settings for changing the users avatar and dark mode theme. Charts are updated dynamically comparing the goals the user sets and the nutritional information from the foods that are added to the log.

## Approach

Built with Next.js for utilizing server side rendering for server components. Typescript for typechecking. Styled with tailwind for responsive design. Using Nutrition API for fetching data. 










 
















<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details. -->
